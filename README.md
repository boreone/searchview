# IconCenterView
a iOS-Style search bar in Android

This view is a custom view which extend EditText, it make the icon and the text show in the center of the view .<br>

it looks like the ios style...so I decided to make a project collection and make this..<br>

but there is also a problem, that is you can't use android:gravity="center".
